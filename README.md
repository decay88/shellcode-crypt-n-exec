This application is a proof of concept in order to demonstrate a way to hide shellcode execution from getting detected by dynamic analysis techniques in Windows binaries. It XOR-encrypts the input shellcode with a user defined password and compiles the resulting binary using certain templates with evasion activities at runtime. It got developed as part of the "IT-Analyst" bachelor thesis at HS-KL University of applied sciences Zweibr√ºcken/Germany.
